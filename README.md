# real-time-human-activity-recognition
Real-Time Human Activity Recognition is a deep learning project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), MobileNetV2, and the UCI HAR Dataset to classify human activities such as walking, running, sitting, standing, laying, ascending, and descending.

The system processes video streams in real-time using OpenCV and predicts human activities frame by frame. It can be extended for healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, sports analytics, and accident detection systems.
